# CriminalIntent
CriminalIntent records the details of “office crimes” – things like leaving dirty dishes in the break room sink 
or walking away from an empty shared printer after documents have printed.
With CriminalIntent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. 
You can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook, or another app.
After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.
CriminalIntent is a complex app that will take 11 chapters to complete. 
It will have a list-detail interface: The main screen will display a list of recorded crimes,
and users will be able to add new crimes or select an existing crime to view and edit its details (Figure 8.1).
